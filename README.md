# Prerequisites


This command-line helper script requires `python3` and `pipenv` on your machine.


# Installation


The installation process simply creates a new pipenv and installs the necessary python packages.


    $ make install


# Usage


The script has two modes of operation - you can either output all sentences coming from the GPS puck or filter by a designated sentence id. NMEA talker ids in this case are all `GP`.


**No filter:**
